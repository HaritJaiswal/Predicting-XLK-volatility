# Predicting-XLK-volatility
Using feature engineering to achieve high score in predicting 5 day volatility of Technology sector SPDR fund

- Build a model with a lower average cross-validated RMSE than the best model that we saw in class (-0.068) for predicting the 5 day volatility for XLK
    - use 20% of the data set for validation in your cross-validation
    - make sure you're using a time-series dependent cross-validation method
    - you may use any transformation and model you would like
    - you will likely need to feature engineer to beat the class model - use what you know about how the time series behaves to your advantage

Note:
- model training can sometimes be expensive, depending on the model - use the learning curve to help you understand how long it would take a model to train
- you will likely get the most yield by feature engineering
- hyperparameter tuning is a higher order optimization, it is useful to get the best result of your chosen model, however if your model is not performant it will rarely make it magically performant
